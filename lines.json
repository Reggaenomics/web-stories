["","Was wandering an infinite stretch of road","Looking out beyond what I could see to be the forest's fold","I wrapped around a bend and then back again","And in my headlights stood a man far from his den","I stopped with a start, red streaking across the brush","The wind had ceased and I felt the hush","This man up ahead, this silhouette against light","His domain was the darkness, his home was the night","I went out to him, and I extended a greeting","He gave a low bow and a feeling so fleeting","began to wash over me as though a sickness did crawl","into my belly and my body threatened to fall","were it not for that smooth and silver voice of his that did slither out,","\"Hello traveler, what brings you out and about?\"","\"I'm on my way to Bennings, I've family fallen ill\"","\"I'm sorry to hear that friend, but a moment of your time still\"","He reached into his pocket and extended to me","What in the shadows and harsh car lights I could not see","I leaned in close to get a good look","And that was all he needed, that was all it took","Into a dark abyss I fell, within the fold of his hand","He did so without budging from the spot he dared stand","His name that confounded me, his name I did know","Could have warned me of the fate that would ensnare me so","But alas I remain in the darkness domain","Where Chernobog rules and weary travelers lay slain","The unruly notes in his inhuman voice","I just acquiesce that I had no choice","The void has taken me and this is my decree","If you see Chernobog out there, be sure to flee."]
